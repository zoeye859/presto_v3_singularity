# SINGULARITY INSTALLATION

I just realised that some presto users (or users-to-be) don't know much about **SINGULARITY** or **DOCKER**.

So I will briefly explaine why I created this singularity image, the idea behind this singularity image, and finally the installation instructions.


## Why created this singularity image?

In short, installing Presto was very much a pain, at least for me :sweat_smile: .

Many dependencies for sure, also it is very hard to decide whether you would go for v2 or v3.

I am a Mac user, but have access to a ubuntu VM. I tried to install Presto twice on Mac (failed), and twice on ubuntu (one failed, the second time I succeeded!! Yay!!)

I make this singularity image to help users to save the pain and **go find pulsars/FRBs as soon as possible**!

## What is a singularity image file?

As I said earlier, I want to save you some time. So you don't have to know too much about singularity (if you do want to, try google).

The best analogy I can think of is like this:

There is a FRB/pulsar-finding expert, whose name is **Presto**. You need to build a house (on your computer) to accomondate this expert.

If you use the singularity image file, you will automatically obatin a lovely portable house :house_with_garden: without building it at all - except for installing the singularity.

Yes yes, your FRB/pulsar-finding expert loves this house. So whenever you move the house, the expert will be with you! 7-24 on call!

This house is very portable for you - you can download it to any of your computers/VMs as long as you have singularities installed. Once downloaded, you can use it across platforms - windows, mac, linux...

## How to install SINGULARITY?

Instructions see official website (https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#)

For **Ubuntu users**, you can simply follow Section 1 in *INSTALLATION RECORDS.md* under the same repo

For **Mac users**, you can download the Singulairty desktop at (https://sylabs.io/singularity-desktop-macos/)

- Once downloaded, double click to open, you will see an installer and an uninstaller. If you have installed a singularity desktop before, please do the uninstaller first and then install.
